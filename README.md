## Requirements

> This script is intended to be executed in a **Kali Linux** environment installed in a **Virtual Machine** with the official [**Kali Linux ISO**](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-installer-images).

Before running the installation script, make sure to execute:
```bash
sudo apt-get update && upgrade
```

## Installation Instructions

Follow the steps below to install the Kali Linux environment using the `install.sh` script:

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eriic1002/kali-environment-autoinstaller.git
   cd kali-environment-autoinstaller
   ```

2. **Grant Execution Permissions**: You must grant execution permissions to the `install.sh` script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x install.sh
   ```

3. **Execute the installer**: You have to execute it as a **non-privileged user** ⚠️:
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

4. Provide your user's password to use commands with sudo.
5. Follow the installation steps.

## Tips
- **Customize the Installation**: You can customize the installation by commenting out the tools you don't want to install in the `install.sh` script or following the script step by step.

- **Picom bugs**: First try to enable "Accelerate 3D graphics" in Virtual Machine Settings (VMWare Workstation). If you have problems with picom, you can try to change the configuration in the `~/.config/picom/picom.conf` file. Or you can delete the picom line of `~/.config/bspwm/bspswmrc` file.

- **Customize the wallpaper**: You can change the wallpaper before installation replacing the `wallpaper.jpg` file in the repository folder. Also, you can change the wallpaper after installation in the `~/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc` file.
